== Overview ==

The wordmorph app finds the minimum number of changes required to transform one word into another, changing only one letter at a time with the restriction that the intermediates are also english words.

Formally, the hamming distance on the set of english words.

Example:
            [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/free free</a> ->]
            ["http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bree '''b'''ree</a> ->]
            ["http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bren bre'''n'''</a> ->]
            ["http://www.dictionary.com/browse/been b'''e'''en</a> ->]
            ["http://www.dictionary.com/browse/beer bee'''r'''</a> ->]
