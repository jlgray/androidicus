This site is intended primarily to be a place for me to play around.  It's pretty fresh, and so necessarily sparse, but of course as time goes on, I hope to remedy that. It seems to work best in Chrome.  Firefox isn't bad, but the site is essentially useless in IE. Its code is a mix JavaScript, <a href="http://jquery.com"> jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">Raphael</a>.

I recently graduated from CU-Boulder with a dual degree in Mathematics and Japanese.  My interests lie in many directions.  
I enjoy playing guitar, free-hand and digital art, bikes, backpacking, languages, puzzles, math, coding, and good ideas in general.  At the moment I am particularly interested in HTML5 and all the richness it promises web applications.  Everything old is new again, but context is still important.
